# TimekeepPh - Selfie Clock-in Implementation Progress

## User Story: U1 - Selfie clock-in (offline capable)
**Description**: As an Employee I can clock in/out with a selfie + GPS even when my phone is offline, so HR always gets authentic timestamps.

## System Architecture (Multi-tenant SaaS)

### Multi-tenancy Strategy
- **Single Database + Tenant ID**: One database with `account_id` on all tenant-specific tables
- **Subdomain-based**: `acme-corp.timekeep.com` identifies tenant, filters data by `account_id`
- **UUIDs**: All models use UUIDs as primary keys for security (prevents URL enumeration)

### Data Models
```
Account (Company/Organization) - UUID primary key
â”œâ”€â”€ Users (Backend access - HR, Admins, Managers) - scoped by account_id
â”œâ”€â”€ Branches (Physical locations) - scoped by account_id  
â””â”€â”€ Employees (Workers who clock in/out) - scoped by account_id
    â””â”€â”€ ClockEntries (Time records with photos/GPS) - scoped through employee
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Camera opens and captures a selfie
- [x] GPS lat/long is captured
- [x] Branch selector is locked after selfie
- [x] If offline, entry is stored locally and auto-syncs within 60s of connection

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Database Models & Migrations
- [x] Configure Rails to use UUIDs as primary keys
- [x] Account model (with subdomain for tenant identification)
- [x] Account model comprehensive TDD tests
- [x] User model (with Devise authentication, scoped by account_id)
- [x] User model comprehensive TDD tests
- [x] Branch model (scoped by account_id)
- [x] Branch model comprehensive TDD tests
- [x] Employee model (scoped by account_id)
- [x] Employee model comprehensive TDD tests
- [ðŸ”„] ClockEntry model (scoped through employee) - IN PROGRESS

### Phase 2: Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Employee identification system
- [ ] Multi-tenant account scoping

### Phase 3: Clock-in Controller & Views
- [ ] Clock-in controller with camera/GPS
- [ ] Clock-in view with camera interface
- [ ] Branch selector component

### Phase 4: Offline Functionality
- [ ] IndexedDB storage via Stimulus
- [ ] Auto-sync mechanism
- [ ] Connection status detection

### Phase 5: Routes & Testing
- [ ] Clock-in routes
- [ ] Tests for all functionality

## Development Approach (Following Sustainable Rails)

### Core Principles Applied
- **Database-First Design**: Proper constraints, indexes, foreign keys at DB level
- **Service Objects**: Complex business logic (clock-in/sync) moved to service classes
- **Form Objects**: Clock-in form handling separated from models
- **Boring Technology**: Standard Rails patterns, avoid over-engineering
- **Security**: Multiple validation layers, strong parameters, tenant isolation

### Key Service Objects Needed
- `ClockInService` - Handles selfie capture, GPS, branch validation
- `OfflineSyncService` - Manages local storage and background sync
- `TenantService` - Account scoping and subdomain resolution

## Next Steps
Starting with UUID configuration and Account model creation...

## Models Schema Design

### Account âœ… IMPLEMENTED
```ruby
# Multi-tenant company/organization (UUID primary key)
class Account < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :users, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :branches, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :employees, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :clock_entries, through: :employees

  normalizes :subdomain, with: ->(subdomain) { subdomain.strip.downcase }
  normalizes :name, with: ->(name) { name.strip }

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :subdomain, presence: true, uniqueness: true, format: { with: /\A[a-z0-9\-]+\z/ }

  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
end
```

### User âœ… IMPLEMENTED
```ruby
# Backend access (HR, Admins, Managers) - UUID primary key
class User < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account

  normalizes :email, with: ->(email) { email.strip.downcase }
  normalizes :name, with: ->(name) { name.strip }

  devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
         :recoverable, :rememberable

  enum :role, { admin: 0, hr: 1, manager: 2 }

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :role, presence: true
  validates :email, presence: true,
                   format: { with: Devise.email_regexp },
                   uniqueness: { scope: :account_id, case_sensitive: false }
  validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6 }, if: :password_required?

  scope :for_account, ->(account) { where(account: account) }

  private

  def password_required?
    !persisted? || !password.nil? || !password_confirmation.nil?
  end
end
```

### Branch âœ… IMPLEMENTED
```ruby
# Physical locations where employees work - UUID primary key
class Branch < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account
  has_many :employees, dependent: :destroy
  has_many :clock_entries, dependent: :destroy

  normalizes :name, with: ->(name) { name.strip }
  normalizes :address, with: ->(address) { address.strip }

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :address, presence: true

  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  scope :for_account, ->(account) { where(account: account) }
end
```

### Employee âœ… IMPLEMENTED
```ruby
# Workers who clock in/out - UUID primary key
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :account
  belongs_to :branch
  has_many :clock_entries, dependent: :destroy

  normalizes :name, with: ->(name) { name.strip }
  normalizes :email, with: ->(email) { email&.strip&.downcase }
  normalizes :employee_id, with: ->(id) { id.strip.upcase }

  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :employee_id, presence: true, uniqueness: { scope: :account_id }
  validates :pin, presence: true, length: { minimum: 4 }

  scope :active, -> { where(active: true) }
  scope :for_account, ->(account) { where(account: account) }

  validate :branch_belongs_to_account

  private

  def branch_belongs_to_account
    return unless branch && account
    errors.add(:branch, "must belong to the same account") if branch.account != account
  end
end
```

### ClockEntry ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
```ruby
# Time records with photos and GPS - UUID primary key
class ClockEntry < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :employee
  belongs_to :branch
  
  validates :employee_id, presence: true
  validates :branch_id, presence: true
  validates :gps_latitude, presence: true, numericality: { in: -90..90 }
  validates :gps_longitude, presence: true, numericality: { in: -180..180 }
  
  scope :pending_sync, -> { where(synced: false) }
  scope :today, -> { where(created_at: Date.current.beginning_of_day..Date.current.end_of_day) }
  scope :for_account, ->(account) { joins(employee: :account).where(employees: { account: account }) }
  
  validate :employee_and_branch_same_account
  
  private
  
  def employee_and_branch_same_account
    return unless employee && branch
    errors.add(:branch, "must belong to same account as employee") if employee.account != branch.account
  end
end
```
